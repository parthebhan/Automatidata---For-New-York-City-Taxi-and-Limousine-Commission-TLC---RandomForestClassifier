# **Automatidata - Machine Learning Model - For New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) - RandomForestClassifier Model**

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day. 

Automatidata is ready to create a machine learning model for TLC. The following tasks are needed to complete the project:

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Model building

    Model evaluation

    Summarize findings for Automatidata and the stakeholders at TLC
    
As a data professional at Automatidata, I've been tasked with creating a machine learning model for the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. Their aim is to develop an application that can predict whether a customer is unlikely to leave a tip. This tool will be invaluable for taxi drivers, as it will help them identify passengers who may not tip, allowing them to make informed decisions about their service.


**As a data professional undertaking this project, the goal is to utilize tree-based modeling techniques to predict whether a customer is likely to leave a generous tip, with the ultimate aim of boosting revenue for taxi cab drivers.**

**Part 1: Ethical considerations**

When considering the ethical implications of this task, I need to contemplate whether the objective of the model should be adjusted to ensure fairness and avoid discrimination.

**Part 2: Feature engineering**

In this stage, I will personally perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation on the data to prepare it for modeling. This involves identifying relevant features that could influence tipping behavior and ensuring the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

**Part 3: Modeling**

For modeling, I will personally build the predictive models, assess their performance, and provide recommendations for next steps based on the outcomes. This may involve fine-tuning the models, exploring additional features, or considering alternative approaches to achieve the desired prediction accuracy.
